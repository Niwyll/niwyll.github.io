This website shows the basics for PWA "Add to home screen" dialog.
The manifest is dynamicaly loaded in the html using lazy loading (*Warning*: could not work on every browser). That permits to dynamicaly change URL and image paths in manifest (useful for exemple when there is a client specific key in the start_url, mandatory for PWA requirements).
